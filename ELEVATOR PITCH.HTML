        As future leaders, CREME QUITESENCE students are guided and shaped by the standards of critical thinking, high achievements, ethical principles and discipline.

OUR MISSION
TO DEVELOP CHILDREN IN SECONDARY SCHOOL INTO WORLD LEADERS THROUGH A RIGOROUS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT COMBINES ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT WITH PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT, 
THEREBY CREATING WELL ADJUSTED, SOCIALLY AWARE AND RESPONSIBLE CHILDREN WHO WILL GO ON TO BECOME "THE PRIDE OF THE NATION"
OUR OBJECTIVE
Every child that passes through this high school must become an effective communicator, a critical thinker, 
an independent learner, an achiever, an ethical individual and a world class citizen.
CAREER PATHS
IN POSITIONING OURSELVES AS ONE OF THE BEST SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN ABUJA, WE DESIGNED FOUR CAREER PATHS FOR STUDENTS AT PREMIERE ACADEMY NAMELY:
-The Core Sciences
-The Science/Technical
-The Business/Social Sciences
-Liberal Arts.
CREME QUITESENCE Academy is a nursery primary and secondary school with excellent boarding provision,
 where personal development, community service, team work and leadership are all 
important aspects of growing and inspiring confident caring international citizens. 
Set on our own grounds in Lugbe, Abuja, FCT, 
OUR modern well-equipped campus is an inspirational place to live, work and learn. 
Our purpose is to ensure that CREME QUITESENCE students have the skills and qualifications to compete with the best, 
the resilience to thrive under pressure and the attitude to capitalize on the opportunity that lie before them. 
These are essential qualities we equip our children with, as they prepare for the challenges and hurdles of the life, 
especially when they pass through higher institutions and begin to make crucial decisions in life as they climb 
the ladders of the future.
We believe our setting, values and commitments, thoughtful, well-rounded, high-achieving young people (staff) make our school truly unique, 
strategically focused on producing future leaders. 
And as the diversity of our students who bring a richness of experience and enthusiasm to  CREME QUITESENCE, 
challenge us to find a niche in which every individual may excel and be valued for all  they achieve in every sphere. 
The self-confidence that this engenders enables our students to capitalize on new situations and challenges.
 It also generates the humility to acknowledge success of others, the compassion to support those who  encounter 
 difficulties and the maturity to take responsibility for themselves.
