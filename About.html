                      <h3>CREME QUITESSENCE.</h3>
                      <P>Our purpose is to ensure that Qreme Quintessence Academy students have the skills and qualifications to compete with the best,
                           the resilience to thrive under pressure and the attitude to capitalize on the opportunity that lie before them. 
                           These are essential qualities we equip our children with, as they prepare for the challenges and hurdles of the life,
                         especially when they pass through 
                          higher institutions and begin to make crucial decisions in life as they climb the ladders of the future.
                          We know our children will flourish better when they live and inter-mix with like minds and young achievers,
                           who have common goals and objectives to achieve. 
                          They tend to exhibit their talents to the fullest spectrum, pushing themselves beyond ordinary limits.
                           Thus we are proud of the range of our curriculum and the extraordinary breadth of our co-curricular provision.
                           We believe our setting, values and commitments, thoughtful, well-rounded, high-achieving young people (staff) 
                           make our school truly unique, strategically focused on producing future leaders. And as the diversity of our 
                           students who bring a richness of experience and enthusiasm to Premiere Academy, challenge us to find a niche 
                           in which every individual may excel and be valued for all  they achieve in every sphere. The self-confidence 
                           that this engenders enables our students to capitalize on new situations and challenges. It also generates 
                           the humility to acknowledge success of others,
                            the compassion to support those who  encounter difficulties and the maturity to take responsibility for themselves.
